# VirtualZooManagementSystem

## Overview

The Virtual Zoo Management System is a software application designed to assist zookeepers in managing and caring for animals within a virtual zoo environment. It provides functionalities for adding new animals, feeding, and giving water to existing animals, as well as viewing detailed information about each animal.

## Features

### Add New Animal
- Allows zookeepers to add new animals to the virtual zoo database.
- Supports specifying the animal's name, age, type, and other relevant details.
- Utilizes a user-friendly interface with text input fields, number boxes, and radio buttons for easy data entry.

### Feed Animals
- Enables zookeepers to feed animals within the virtual zoo.
- Displays a list of all animals currently in the zoo, allowing users to select individual animals for feeding.
- Implements feeding functionality with the click of a button, updating the animal's hunger level accordingly.

### Give Water
- Provides a mechanism for giving water to animals in the virtual zoo.
- Similar to the feeding feature, users can select animals from a list and give them water with the click of a button.
- Updates the animal's thirst level in response to the action.

### See All Animals
- Allows users to view detailed information about all animals present in the virtual zoo.
- Displays information such as the animal's name, species, diet type, feeding schedule, and water intake level.
- Supports easy navigation and browsing through the list of animals.

## Design Decisions

- **Database Backend**: Utilized a database to store and manage animal data, offering scalability and efficiency.
- **GUI Design**: Prioritized simplicity in the graphical user interface (GUI) design to enhance usability and user experience.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Implemented a class hierarchy for animals, promoting code reusability and maintainability.
- **Error Handling**: Incorporated error handling mechanisms to address potential issues and ensure robustness of the application.
- **Feedback Mechanisms**: Integrated notification pop-ups to provide users with feedback on actions such as feeding or giving water to animals.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement additional features such as animal health monitoring, habitat management, and staff scheduling.
- Enhance the user interface with more visually appealing elements and interactive components.
- Introduce support for multi-platform deployment to increase accessibility and reach a wider audience.
- Incorporate machine learning algorithms for predictive analytics and decision support in animal care and management.
